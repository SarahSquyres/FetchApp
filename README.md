# My List App

## Application Description

My List App provides a user-friendly interface for viewing lists of items.  The items are organized by List ID for a better user experience. 
Users can select a specific group to view its corresponding list, which is scrollable and sorted by item name. 
The IDE used for this application is Android Studio and the language used is Kotlin. The application makes a Http request to an API endpoint and returns a list of objects. I have built the UI to display the information in an organized and intuitive interface.
